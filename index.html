<!--Paragraph 1-->
    <p>Hello! I figured I would use our first assignment to share a little bit
    information about me.  As you can see my name is Christina.  I was born
    in Toms River, NJ.  However, the past 8 years, up until the summer before
    college, I've lived in York, Pennsylvaina. Even though I live less than
    a mile from the ocean, I'm not a beach person.  I don't like the sand and I
    don't like like the idea of not being able to see what's around me when I'm
    in the water.</p>
<!--Paragraph 1-->
    <p>In my freetime, I enjoy playing golf.  I've been constantly playing
       for about 16 years now.  I've been in tournament all over the East Coast
       and made states for my High school team back in Pennsylvaina.  Aside from
       golf, I enjoy creating artwork using mediums like oil, watercolor,
       spraypaint, and graphite.  I love action and horror movies.  I play a lot
       of games and I build PCs from my friends.  Also, frogs are my favorite
       animal and my favorite color is a pastel yellow.</p>
  </body>
